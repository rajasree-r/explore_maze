Maze game with GUI
This is my step for understanding Java in detail. I started my Java journey with "Head First Java", practicing small programs. This is an attempt to make a Maze game by using Java code. This is not a project I wrote from the scratch. I referred many projects & a lot of stackoverflow posts for creating this project. The intention behind this project is to learn separation of concerns in Java. Any one can refer to this project for learning & if any doubts, please feel free to contact me.
